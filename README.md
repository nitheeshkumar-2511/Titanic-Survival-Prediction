# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

The Titanic challenge on Kaggle is a competition in which the task is to predict the survival or the death of a given passenger based on a set of variables describing him such as his age, his sex, or his passenger class on the boat.

This is my first try on the challenge, even my first project on the field of Machine Learning. I am a new guy in the field. I make the prediction via the **Desicion Tree Classifier**. My work is stored in the file `titanic-survival-prediction.ipynb` and. My final result is stored in the file `submission.csv`. 



## Overview (from Kaggle)

The data has been split into two groups:

- training set (`train.csv`)
- test set (`test.csv`)


We also include **gender_submission.csv**, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.

### Variable Notes

**pclass**: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

**age**: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

**sibsp**: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

**parch**: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
